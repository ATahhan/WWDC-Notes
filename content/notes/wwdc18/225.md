## `UICollectionViewLayout`’s `prepare()`

`UICollectionViewLayout`’s `prepare()` method is called whenever the layout is invalidated, and in the case of `UICollectionFlowLayout`, our layout is invalidated whenever the `UICollectionView`'s bounds of size changes. 

For example when our app rotates on a phone or when our app is resized on an iPad. This is a great place to do any customization that takes the size of the `UICollectionView` into account.

## `PerformBatchUpdates`
