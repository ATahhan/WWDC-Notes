- Faster builds
- Better performances for Swift tools
- Swift 5 is gonna be released in early 2019 (with ABI stability): 
  - Apps won‚Äôt need to be shipped with Swift embedded in the bundle because they can just use the iOS Swift runtime (after Swift 5 and a new iOS update is released)
  - This is a win for every app in memory usage and start up time
- With Xcode 10 we have two optimizations options: 
![][compilationImage]
  - Compilation Mode: this is how your project builds:
    - Whole Module: all the files in your target are always built together, this enables maximum opportunity for optimization (slow build but get best performance at run time)
    - Incremental: not all the files are always built all together (faster build but slower run time performance)

- 
  - ‚ö†Ô∏èIn debug mode you should use Incremental otherwise everytime you touch a file every single file in the whole project gets rebuilt ‚ö†Ô∏è
  - Optimization Level: this is where you choose which optimization you‚Äôd like to have:
    - No optimization
    - Optimize for Speed: Faster code, bigger code output
    - Optimize for Size: Code size is reduced by 10/30%, performance is 5% slower

- (Swift‚Äôs) ARC improvements (which results in faster code runtime)
- New in Swift 4.2:
  - Enums can conform to the new protocol `CaseIterable` to gain a new property `.allCases` (which returns an array of all the possible cases)
  - Conditional Conformance: if you try to compare two collections (say two arrays, even with Optionals, Dictionaries) of elements that are comparable (aka Equatable), then the two arrays are automatically comparable as well. Eg:
![][coinsArrayImage]

- 
  - The same works for Codable, Hashable and Decodable conformances üòç
- (Swift 4.1 actually) Synthesized Equatable and Hashable Conformance: A struct/class is automatically Equatable/Hashable if all its properties also are. This is super powerful because it works with generics as well! This:
![][either1Image]
Is now this:
![][either2Image]
-
  - Hashable Improvements:
The Hashable protocol doesn‚Äôt require a hash Int property anymore but:
![][hashable1Image]
You can feed the Hasher with multiple values to hash together and the Hasher will take care of creating the hash for you. This is how you now conform to Hashable:
![][hashable2Image]
‚ö†Ô∏èHash values will change every time you run the app.

- 
  - Generating Random Numbers:
    - All numeric types have a static random function: the new method, which takes a range as a parameter, returns a random number within that range.
    - Bool also get a `.random()`
    - Collections get a `.randomElement()` method, which returns a `Element?` (optional because if the collection is empty this method returns `nil`)
    - Arrays get a `.shuffled()` method that returns the same array with elements put in a random order üòç
    - All the methods above have an optional random number generator parameter input that you can use if you want to use your own random number generator instead of the default Swift one.

- 
  - Instead of using:
    ![][ifOsImage]
    You can now use:
    ![][canImportImage]
    (note the canImport macro and the new build error #error)
  - No more FIXME/TODOs in Swift, use #warning instead:
    ![][warningImage]

- 
  - This session completely ignores `@dynamicMemberLookup`.
