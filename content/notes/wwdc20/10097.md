# Sample Code
Download the [sample code](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/views_and_controls/collection_views/implementing_modern_collection_views) to learn more about Modern Collection Views.

# Modern Collection View APIs Overview
![][modern_collection_view_apis]

# Diffable Data Source
## Recap

* Introduced in iOS 13.
* Simplifies UI State.
* Automatic animations.
* More to watch session [220](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/220) from WWDC 19: Advances in UI Data Sources.

## New to iOS 14
### [Section Snapshots](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/nsdiffabledatasourcesectionsnapshotreference)
* It encapsulates the data for a single section in a UICollectionView.
* Allow data sources to be more composable into section-sized chunks of data. (It's able to present same data use different layout in different sections.)
* Allow modeling of hierarchical data, which is needed to support rendering outline-style UIs.

#### Examples
![][section_snapshots]

* Top: Horizontally scrolling section.
* Middle: Outline style section.
* Bottom: List section.

# Compositional Layout
## Recap
* Introduced in iOS 13.
* Allow us to build rich, complex layouts by composing smaller, easy-to-reason bits of layout together.
* Describe what you want the layout to look like instead of how the layout ought to work.
* Provide section-specific layouts.
* More to watch session [215](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/215) from WWDC 19: Advances in Collection View Layout.

## New to iOS 14
### [Lists](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicollectionviewcompositionallayout)
* UITableView like appearance.
* Lists are rich with features like swipe actions and many common cell layouts.
* List is built on top of Compositional Layout.
* New concrete UICollectionViewListCell.
* Header and footer support
* Sidebar appearance.

#### Examples
Creating a UICollectionViewLayout where every section in the collection view is a list with an inset grouped appearance.

```swift
let configuration = UICollectionLayoutListConfiguration(appearance: .insetGrouped)
let layout = UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout.list(using: configuration)
```

# Modern Cells
## [Cell Registrations](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicollectionview/cellregistration)
* A brand new way to configure cells.
* A simple, re-usable way to set up a cell from a view model.
* Eliminate the extra step of registering a cell class or nib to associate it with a re-use identifier.
* Use a generic registration type which incorporates a configuration closure for setting up a new cell from a view model.

```swift
let reg = UICollectionView.CellRegistration<MyCell, ViewModel> { cell, indexPath, model in
   // configure cell content 
}

let dataSource = UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource<S,I>(collectionView: collectionView) {
                     collectionView, indexPath, item -> UICollectionViewCell in
   return collectionView.dequeueConfiguredReusableCell(using: reg, for: indexPath, item: item)
}
```

## [Cell Content Configurations](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uilistcontentconfiguration)
* Similar to UITableViewCell types.
* Use with any cell or even a generic UI view.
* Flexible.
* Lightweight.

```swift
var contentConfiguration = UIListContentConfiguration.cell()
contentConfiguration.image = UIImage(systemNamed:"hammer")
contentConfiguration.text = "Ready. Set. Code"
cell.contentConfiguration = contentConfiguration
```

## [Background Configurations](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uibackgroundconfiguration)
* Similar to content configurations but applied to any cell's background with the ability to adjust properties such as color, border styles, and more.

```swift
cell.backgroundConfiguration = UIBackgroundConfiguration.clear()
```
