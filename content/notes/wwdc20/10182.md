# What’s new in Wallet and Apple Pay

* `PKPaymentPass` was replaced with a new class `PKSecureElementPass`. The new class has the same properties as `PKPaymentPass`, so it’s encouraged to use this one.

* `PKPaymentButton` didn’t change that much, only new button types were added for renting, top up, etc..
* Now the payment button can derive its light/dark style theme from the system by supplying an automatic style to the button:
```swift
var automaticButton = PKPaymentButton(paymentButtonType: .plain, paymentButtonStyle: .automatic)
```
> You can also ask specifically for light or dark mode in the same way

* Now Catalyst and native macOS apps supports paying with Apple Pay in the same way it’s implemented on web pages
* Also, instead of asking the WebKit for a URL for Apple Pay and validate that URL against known Apple hostnames, there is now a static URL you can always send your `POST` request to directly: `apple-pay-gateway.apple.com`

## Contacts formatting improvements
* in iOS 14, when contact data is coming from Apple Pay, you will see more consistent data and less variation
* Also, users are now prompted to correct issues in their contact information earlier, so they get to fix it sooner in the process.
