## Architecting for sharing across apps
### App groups

- How To:
  1. Create and enable app groups in the `Signing & Capabilities` of your project(s) file in Xcode (add a new `App Groups` capability)
  2. Enable it in the developer portal

- App Groups enable sharing data via [`UserDefaults`][usDoc] (via a [shared suite][suiteDoc]) and shared files
  
### Build and use Swift packages

## testing your apps for reliability
## managing your app after production release
