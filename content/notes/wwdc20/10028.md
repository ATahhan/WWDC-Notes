## What Makes A Great Widget

* Glanceable: a great widget displays the right amount of content
* Relevant: a great widget displays relevant content to the user, based on time and importance, this is very important for Smart Stack, too
* Personalized: a great widget supports as many sizes as possible, and let the user choose the widget intents via the widget configuration
* Widget are not mini apps

## Recap

* Smart Stack: A collection of widgets sorted by widget relevance
* [`WidgetKit`][wkDoc]: New framework providing widgets functionality
* Siri Shortcut

### How Widgets Works
![][widget_works]

* `WidgetKit` extensions are basically background extensions that draw a view hierarchy over time
* Data can be refreshed from main app 
* Schedule updates can be done right from the extension

### Defining a Widget

* Kind: Each widget can support multiple kinds of widgets, for example `single stock widget`, `list stock widget`, and `detail stock widget`
* Configuration: Either `StaticConfiguration` or `IntentConfiguration`

![][static_configuration]

![][intent_configuration]

* [`WidgetFamily`][wf]: a.k.a. the template a widget uses, can be any combination of small, medium, or large
* Placeholder: A temporary view WidgetKit uses to render the widget for the first time, generic representation of the widget

![][widget_code_example]

### Creating a Glanceable Experience

* Stateless UI
* No scrolling
* No videos or animated images
* Easy tap interactions with deep link into our app

### Views, Timelines, and Reloads

* [Snapshot][snap]: when the system requests one, our widget should provide its current representation
* Timelines are combinations of a view and a date, that tells the system at what time that view should be shown

### [TimelineProvider][tp] Definition

```swift
public protocol TimelineProvider {
    associatedType Entry: TimelineEntry
    typealias Context = TimelineProviderContext

    func snapshot(with context: Self.Context, 
                    completion: @escaping (Self.Entry) -> ())

    func timeline(with context: Self.Context, 
                    completion: @escaping (Timeline<Self.Entry>) -> ())

}
```

* Entry: mainly a date
* Context: environment information
* Snapshot: system ask the single entry
* Timeline: system ask series of entry and attached reload policy

#### [Timeline Reload policy][reload]

When our extension [`TimelineProvider`][tp] is asked to provide a [`Timeline`][tl], we also need to define our reload policy:

* `atEnd`: tells `WidgetKit` to request a new timeline only after the date of the last entry has passed
* `after(date: Date)`: tells `WidgetKit` to request a new timeline only after a specified date
* `Never`: tells `WidgetKit` to never request a new timeline, the app will let `WidgetKit` know when a new timeline is available

### Networking

* We can use `URLSession` to kick off a task and use batch request as well background session. 
* Be careful with how much network request is needed.

### Personalization and Intelligence Aspects

* Driven by two major contexts: Intent and relevance
* Intents framework is the same used with siri shortcut, etc
* Power of intents for dynamic options capability
* The widget relevance is particularly useful when the user has multiple widgets into a smart stack: the stack will be sorted based each entry [`TimelineEntryRelevance`][rel], duration, and more
