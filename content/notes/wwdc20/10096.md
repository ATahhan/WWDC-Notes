Playgrounds have been integrated with the new build system in Xcode 12. It enables three new capabilities:
- Playgrounds in Swift packages
- Playgrounds in Xcode projects
- Playgrounds can include resources

## Playgrounds in Swift packages
You can include a playground inside your Swift package to make it a "executable documentation". This allows you to mix markdown and runnable code together.

Demo: NutritionFacts package, with a playground as documentation

## Playgrounds in Xcode projects
You can add a playground in your Xcode project, import modules from your project target, and have them built and executed in the playground.

A new playground option `Build Active Scheme` is required for this to work. It is enabled by default for new playgrounds created.

Demo: Fruta iOS project, with a `SmoothieLab` playground to invent new recipes and display a "Chart View" of its nutrition content. The "Chart View" component is imported from the Fruta project itself.

Xcode build logs are now available for playgrounds too. This helps debugging build errors when running the playground. You can see the dependency modules being built first, then the playground target itself.

## Playgrounds can inlcude resources
Playgrounds can now include resources like image catalog and machine learning models.

Demo: ML models in a playground to recognize ingredient image assets from Fruta.

The steps to make it work in the demo are:
- Copy the image assets from Fruta projec and paste it to Desktop
- Create a new blank playground
- Drag in assets folder from Desktop into the playground
- Download a `CoreML` model `YOLOv3`, and drag into playground
- Create `Vision` requests using the `YOLOv3` model, and perform image recognition over the ingredient images

The result looks like this:
