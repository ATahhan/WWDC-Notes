Playgrounds have been integrated with the new build system in Xcode 12. It enables three new capabilities:
- Playgrounds in Swift packages
- Playgrounds in Xcode projects
- Playgrounds can include resources

## Playgrounds in Swift packages
You can include a playground inside your Swift package to make it a "executable documentation". This allows you to mix markdown and runnable code together.

Demo: NutritionFacts package, with a playground as documentation

## Playgrounds in Xcode projects
You can add a playground in your Xcode project, import modules from your project target, and have them built and execute in the playground.
A new playground option `Build Active Scheme` is required for this to work. It is enabled by default for new playgrounds.

Demo: Fruta iOS project, with a `SmoothieLab` playground to invent new recipes and see a "Chart View" live. The "Chart View" component is imported from the Fruta project itself.

Xcode build logs are now available for playgrounds too. This is helpful in debugging build errors when running the playground. You can see the dependency modules being built first, then finally the playground target itself.

## Playgrounds can inlcude resources
Playgrounds can now include reousrces like image catalog and machine learning models.

Demo: ML models in a playground to recognize ingredient image assets from Fruta.

The steps to make it work in the demo are:
- Copy paste image assets out of Xcode
- Create a new blank playground
- Drag in assets folder into playground.
- Download a CoreML model YOLOv3, and drag into playground.
- Create Vision requests using YOLOv3 model, and perform image recognition over the ingredient images.

The result looks like this:
