Managing pointers safely means knowing all the different ways they can be unsafe.

## Levels of safety

![][levels_of_safety]

| Level of safety | Swift API                      | Description                                                                                                              |
|-----------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Safe            | `collections`, `slices`, `iterators` | Safe code. It's recommended write code at the highest safety level possible.                                             |
| Unsafe          | `UnsafePointer<T>`               | UnsafePointer lets use pointers without worrying about type safety. |
| Raw             | `UnsafeRawPointer`               | UnsafeRawPointer lets you work with raw memory as a sequence of bytes.                                                   |
| Mutable type    | Memory-binding APIs            | Swift provides a few APIs for binding memory to types.                                                                   |

### Safe Swift code

![][safe_swift_code]

* Safe code isn't necessarily correct code but it does behave predictably.
* The compiler will catch the error if a programming error can lead to unpredictable behavior.
* Runtime checks guarantee the error will make the program crashes immediately.
* Safe code is really about error enforcement.

### Unsafe Swift code

![][unsafe_swift_code]

* Testing provides helpful diagnostics, but depends on the level of safety.
* Unsafe standard library APIs have assertions and debug builds that catch certain kinds of invalid input.
* Adding own preconditions to verify unsafe assumptions is a good practice.
* Sanitizer Diagnostics are great to pinpoint bugs, but don't catch all undefined behavior.
* When errors are not uncovered during testing they can lead to unexpected runtime behavior, the worst thing is corrupting or losing data.
