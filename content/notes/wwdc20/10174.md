## Introduction to App Clips

1- App Clips need an app to work with
2- It starts as an App Clip experience that's initiated by a URL
3- App Clip itself is a separate binary shipped with the original app and can be launched on its own

## App Clip Experiences

* Entry points to an App
* Invoked by URLs registered in the App Store Connect
* The process of reading those URLs is very similar to Universal Links
* Surfaced through user actions and proactively as Siri suggestions

## App Clip

* It's build and run as a separate application, so it needs to handle the whole experience on its own
* Though it runs on its own, it's created as a secondary target within the main application in Xcode and all submitted together to the App Store Review
* If app is launched through an App Clip Experience, your App Clip will be installed, otherwise, main app is preferred
* App Clip should include only what's needed for the experience
* It should generally omit top level navigation elements (like tabbars), and should instead deeplink directly into the intended experience
* App Clips can do many things in different contexts and each with a different link, but ideally should do only one thing at a time.

## Demo

(omitted from notes, but shows that you can include different kinds of resources, i.e. code, assets, etc.. and use Swift Compiler Flags to leave out unneeded code from being included in the App Clip target)

## Technology Overview

* Can be built using `UIKit` or `SwiftUI`
* [`NSUserActivity`][nsUserActivityDoc] should be used to differentiate between different experiences based on the received App Clip link
* App Clip is allowed to use any API in the iOS SDK, unlike other extensions
* Access to user data in App Clips is more limited than main Apps
* There is a "Location Confirmation" API that can be used to confirm where do you think the user's location might be when the user don't feel like sharing his location to an App Clip (more on that in the [`Streamline Your App Clip`][streamlineSessionLink] session)

## Things to Consider

* Access to personal information is limited
* Can only be launched by the user or in response to app clip URL
* Universal links, document types and URL schemes aren't available
* App clips local storage is temporary and will be deleted in couple of days on system discretion, unless the user uses it again, in which case its lifetime increases and it may never be cleaned up
* You can use App Clips shared group container to store data from the App Clip for your main app to retrieve when the user installs it
* You can use [`SKOverlay`][skOverlayDoc] to offer the full app
* Use [`ASAuthorizationController`][authorizationControllerDoc] to signin or signup
