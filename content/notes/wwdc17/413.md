## Startup time
Time spent before the app `main()` is executed

## Launch Closure
All of the information necessary to launch an application (what dylibs the app uses, what the offsets in them are for various symbols, where their code signatures are).

Tips:

- Embed fewer dylibs
- Declare fewer classes/methods
- Use fewer initializers

Use the Static Initializer tracer in instruments to profile your startup time

The session continues with a detailed history of Dyld, which is awesome and way too long to write here. Just watch the session or read its transcript.
