Make sure the app accessibility is: 

- Understandable: Labels
- Interactable: Actions
- Navigable: Ordering and Grouping

## Accessibility notifications

E.g. after pressing the equal button `=` on a calculator app, we can fire an accessibility notification telling Siri that the result value has changed.

## Making Images More Accessible

- Images can be created with an optional [`label` parameter][labelDoc], this parameter will be used by voiceover and the likes.

- If an image is not part of the core experience we can initialize it with the [`decorative` parameter][decorativeDoc], this way it will be ignored by the accessibility system features.
