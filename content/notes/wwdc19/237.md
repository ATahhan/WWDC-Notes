- `View` always has the size of its body
- The `rootView` has the dimensions of the device minus the safe area insets.
- The top layer of any view with a body is always what we call **layout neutral**. Because its view bounds are define by the bounds of its body, regardless of what’s _above_.

## Layout Process

Three steps:

1. The root view offers our view a proposed size (the safe layout area)
2. The view answers with the size it would like
3. The root view, know with its child view size knowledge, put the child somewhere (by default at the center of its size, both vertically and horizontally)

In SwiftUI there's no way to force a size on the view's child: the parent has to respect that choice. 

In short:

1. Parent proposes a size for child
2. Child chooses its own size
3. Parent places child in parent’s coordinate space
4. (Bonus) SwiftUI rounds coordinates to the nearest pixel

## Views sizes

Since every view controls its own size, it means when we build a view, we get to decide how and when it resizes. 

The bounds of a `Text` view never stretch beyond the height and width of its displayed lines.

When we need to fight for space, especially in stack views, we can raise the layout priority by setting the view [`layoutPriority`][layoutPriorityDoc] (`0` by default).

## Custom Alignment

Need of an alignment between views of different stacks?

We can achieve so by creating an extension of [`VerticalAlignment`][verticalAlignemntDoc] (or any other alignment), and then use that as our [`.alignmentGuide`][guideDoc] in the interested views.

## Graphics

- SwiftUI has some built in shapes ([`Circle`][circleDoc] for example) that conforms to the [`Shape`][shapeDoc] protocol and has their own modifiiers, but because that all shapes are effectivly rendered as `View`s, modifiers of shapes can be applied to views and vice versa

- [`Styling`][stylingDoc] is used to convert shapes into views, available predefined shapes are [`Rectangle`][rectangleDoc], [`RoundedRectangle][roundedRectangeDoc], [`Circle`][circleDoc], [`Capsule`][capsuleDoc], [`Ellipse`][ellipseDoc], and [`Gradient`s][gradientDoc]

- You can create custom shapes by conforming to the [`Shape`][shapeDoc] protocol and implementing the function [`path(in:)`][pathFunctionDoc] that draws a path representing the required shape

- By implementing [`animatableData`][animatableDataDoc] property in your custom shapes, you can tell the SwiftUI system how this shape can be interpolated for animations

- The default transition animation for views is to just fade-in/fade-out when they're drawn and removed from the screen. You can customize those transitions
by creating a custom [`ViewModifier`][viewModifierDoc] and telling it how it should change between the *end states* of an animation, then including that [`ViewModifier`][viewModifierDoc] in an [`asymmetric`][asymmetricDoc] transition

- [`ViewModifier`][viewModifierDoc]s in SwiftUI are just `View`s that are defined as a function of some other view. This can be clearily seen when creating a custom `ViewModifier` that you will have to implement a `body` *function* that takes in a `Content` as a parameter (which is a `View`) and returns `some View`.

- By default, SwiftUI renders all views natively as a UIView or as an NSView based on the platform it's rendering for, and that's typically what we want for our normal controls like `Button`s and `TextField`s. But if you want to get a better perofrming render for a lot of views then you may want to embed all your views inside a [`drawingGroup`][drawingGroupDoc], which is a special way of rendering graphics that converts all your views hierarchy into one `UIView` or `NSView` that renders everything else using Metal.
