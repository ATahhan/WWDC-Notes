The most important goal as an API designer: _Clarity at the point of use_.

## `@DynamicMemberLookup`

It can be used to expose all the properties of a hidden object as if they belonged to the main object.

![][dynImage]

## `@PropertyWrapper`

- Provides similar benefits to the built-in lazy
- Eliminates boilerplate.
- Documents semantics at the point of definition.

Property Wrappers can be seen as generic getters and a setters:
![][genImage]
![][typeImage]

We can even pass values to the property initializer:

![][valImage]
![][val2Image]
